Light fork of fluidsynth (1.0.9, without glib dependencies) for embedded devices (tested successfully on STM32F746 with external memory https://github.com/julbouln/stm32f7discovery_midi_synth).

- read sample from disk on demand instead of loading everything in memory
- optimised DSP functions for ARM Cortex-M4

Includes an example synth for linux (LightFluidSynth.hpp & synth.cpp) using RtAudio and RtMidi.
